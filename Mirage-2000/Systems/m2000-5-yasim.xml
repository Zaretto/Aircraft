'''' Buckaroo's note
' This FDM is mostly my wild guesses and approximations. I have no serious
' information or research on the Mirage 2000. My objective is to make a
' reasonable, fun to fly FDM using the basic parameters of commonly available
' information and Emmanuel's model.
' 
' Currently the model will not achieve the top speeds of Mach 2+ at 36000'
' without additional fuel. It somewhat exceeds the original FDM's estimated
'  cruise of 512 KIAS at 20000' using 80% dry power.
' 
' The standard autopilot will hold at about 50% power at 20000'. Above that it
' starts porpoising. This is likely due to several factors. The flight neutral
' point is intentionally positioned to try to be at or slightly ahead of the CG,
' and the trimming stabilizer is positioned at the trailing edge of the wing,
' giving a short stabilizer moment arm. At higher speeds this will give the
' default autopilot fits. A custom AP can probably cope with this, but AP's
' aren't my thing.
' 
' If you import this FDM into Blender using Melchior's excellent importer
' script, you'll see a stabilizer and that the wing is shifted slightly forward
' compared to Emmanuel's model. These are intentional adjustments. See my notes
' below.
' 
' Takeoff :
'   My takeoffs were practiced using 80% dry power (currently there's no option
'   to disable afterburners). Rotate at 145-150. A little back elevator trim
'   helps, about 10% or so.
' 
' Landing :
'   Approach at 170 kts, land between 140-150. I don't recommend using the
'   spoilers during final, but once down they help a lot to slow the aircraft.
'   (I had to add some keyboard spoiler controls.)
' 
' Cruise :
'   The plane is set to require near neutral elevator trim at cruise speeds, so
'   much of the lower-speed flight may benefit from keeping a little elevator
'   trim.
' 
' Afterburners :
'   I think there's typically a switch to engage/disengage burners at some
'   throttle position, but right now the burners are turned on when you reach
'   80% throttle and can't be disabled.
' 
' I have no idea what real V-speeds are in this bird, so this is all fantasy.
' 
' I added control settings for slats, disabled speedbrakes for the solver's
' approach solution, and enabled afterburners for the cruise (maximum level
' speed) settings.
' I also increased cruise speed to the maximum statistics given for the plane in
' level flight at 36000'. This speed is somewhat silly given fuel would be
' depleted very quickly, but it's a reference.
' The second reference is the original FDM cruise of 516 kts at 20000'.
' Currently the model exceeds the lower reference, but won't quite exceed
' Mach 2, so it's a compromise.

  '''' Buckaroo's notes
  ' Anhedral is usually used to counter excessive roll stability or dutch roll
  ' problems, and since the model doesn't exhibit those behaviors it's worth
  ' considering reducing the effective anhedral amount. Currently I left
  ' dihedral unchanged at -4.
  ' 
  ' I reduced stall AoA slightly from 20. Delta wings typical stall higher than
  ' high-aspect forms so I'd expect something in the 17-20 range, but I think
  ' YASim is too generous on stall AoA, possibly due to how "width" is
  ' implemented. So I reduced stall to 18 and changed slats to give an AoA bonus
  ' of +2 (the original was +20, a typo?), for a total stall with slats deployed
  ' of 20 degrees. It's hard to pull the model into these alpha realms anyway,
  ' at least with my current hstab settings. Not sure about the real plane.
  ' 
  ' Camber was increased to add more lift at low alphas, mainly to help rotation
  ' at takeoff. The airfoil appears to have a considerable camber anyway.
  ' I didn't try to find airfoil data; these military types are usually very
  ' proprietary and hard to find info.
  ' 
  ' I reduced aileron lift considerably. The original FDM was very snappy on
  ' rolls, and autopilot can't find solutions at modest to high speeds with such
  ' high values. I have no idea how the real aircraft handles, but it responds
  ' nicely at these settings.
  ' I also removed the src0="-0.5" src1="0.5" dst0="-0.9" dst1="0.9" as I didn't
  ' know what that was for and it simplified testing to remove it.
  ' 
  ' I added a control input for slats.
  ' The real aircraft has a neutral point very close or even slightly forward of
  ' the CG. I also believe YASim tends to calculate lift a little too far aft
  ' (33% MAC), so I moved the wing forward a little, 0.3 meters.
  ' The original position is x="-1.202". This is totally guesswork. Mostly my
  ' aim is to keep the CG about 0.2 meters ahead of the main wheels, and the
  ' center of lift slightly ahead of that.
  ' 
  ' Other values tweaked for solver results.
  ' Airbrakes (spoilers) may be a little too effective, but I didn't adjust
  ' them.

  '''' Buckaroo's notes
  ' YASim wasn't designed for flying-wings/delta-wings and requires a horizontal
  ' stabilizer for trimming. The original hstab was essentially a duplicate of
  ' the main wing used for trim. While this can work, it doubles the wing, kinda
  ' like a biplane with one wing overlaid on the other, with duplicated drag and
  ' lift results. I believe the engine has to work much harder for the
  ' approach/cruise numbers, and YASim compensates by giving a large drag/lift
  ' spread, making the plane very slick. My alternative was to create a
  ' short-chord, high-aspect tail surface roughly
  '
  ' positioned along the wing trailing edge, with a critical AoA slightly higher
  ' than the wing. This method greatly reduces the drag/lift spread. It's very
  ' close to the wing though, so the stabilizer moment arm is pretty short and
  ' I'm guessing it may result in instability issues at some speeds/attitudes.
  '
  ' Current elevator lift settings won't quite allow a full power-off stall. Any
  ' more and the auto-pilot can't tune results at higher airspeeds. This could
  ' be refined after the plane gets its own custom auto-pilot or other automatic
  ' controllers. The current values gives pretty reasonable approaches with a
  ' little elevator trim. Since I don't know how the real plane responds, this
  ' seems OK for now.
  '
  ' The 'spoiler' here is likely for use with a parachute simulation. I didn't

  ' The big addition here is exhaust-speed. The default value is 1555 kts.
  ' Assuming a max speed of 1350 at 36000' (which is likely under the most
  ' optimal conditions), by the time we approached that speed we'd only have
  ' (1 - 1350/1555) * max_thrust, or about 13%. Under those conditions it would
  ' take a long time to get to that altitude and speed, and the afterburners
  ' would probably drain the fuel tanks long before we got there.
  '
  ' Without radically and unreasonably changing other FDM values, the only
  ' number available to tune is exhaust-speed, so I had to increased this by
  ' 50%. I don't think YASim models this well, particularly with afterburners.
  ' Perhaps there should be a separate value to be applied when afterburners are
  ' engaged.
  '
  ' I moved the mass of the engine back from x="-1.2". The engines in these
  ' configurations tend to be much further back in the fuselage than appearances
  ' suggest. -3 is just a guess but pretty reasonable. Not a big deal, but
  ' affects the mass distribution and moment stuff.
  ' 
  ' I changed the action point to center it approximately about the thrust
  ' chamber, rather than aft of the aircraft and slightly high. There's a small
  ' cheat here: I lowered the action point from z="-0.534" to z="-0.634" so
  ' thrust is closer to the CG, reducing the early pitching moment on the
  ' takeoff roll so the plane will rotate around 150 kts. Otherwise rotation
  ' speeds are rather high at military power takeoff thrust or better.
